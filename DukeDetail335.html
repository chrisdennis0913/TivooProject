<h4>Orion String Quartet & Windscape</h4><p>Category: Arts</p><p>Description: BACH: The Art of the Fugue for String Quartet and Wind Quintet, BWV 1080 (arr.

In Durham, these institutions combine their forces in the landmark Art of the Fugue, where Bach elaborates a simple subject toward profound complexity without specifying any particular instrumentation.
