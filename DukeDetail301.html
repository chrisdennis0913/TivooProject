<h4>Duke Med Elementary 3rd Grade Program Lunch and Lecture</h4><p>Category: Other</p><p>Description: Duke Med Elementary, affiliated with GPSC and originating from Duke Medical School, is a dynamic service club that aims to teach local 3rd grade students the importance of healthy lifestyles. We will cover curriculum on the cardiovascular system (with a pig heart dissection!) in the fall. This is a one hour lunch with a local elementary school in Durham. Through this program, we hope to spark interest in the health sciences and encourage these young-ens to pursue higher levels of education.

Activities will include lunch, lecture, and small group activities.</p><p>Link: dukemedelementary.com</p><p>Start: 12:00 on September 30, 2011.</p><p>Finish: 23:15 on March 4, 2012.</p><p>Location: Duke South Clinic Amphitheater</p><br /><a href="Calendar.html">Back to Calendar</a></body></html>
