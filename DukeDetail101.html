<h4>Ten Years Later: Battlefield Boundaries and Drones in the Fight Against al-Qaeda</h4><p>Category: Conferences</p><p>Description: Professor Michael Lewis from Ohio Northern University and our own Professor Charlie Dunlap will conduct a panel on how the US interpretation of International Humanitarian Law (the laws of war) has developed in the last 10 years in response to the conflict with AQ. This topic includes battlefield boundaries and drone warfare.  Professor Lewis is a former Navy Top Gun pilot and international law professor, and Professor Dunlap is a retired Air Force Major General in the JAG Corps, so their experience and knowledge of the topic is considerable. Please join us for a discussion of the evolution of the war that has defined our lifetimes. Chick-Fil-A will be served and there will be a generous time allotment for questions.
