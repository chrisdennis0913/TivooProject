<h4>Zakir Hussain & Rakesh Chaurasia</h4><p>Category: Arts</p><p>Description: In this unforgettable concert of intricately melodious music for tabla and flute, two great dynasties of Indian classical music converge.
 
Worldwide percussion icon Zakir Hussain is the son of legendary tabla player Alla Rakha, and returns to Page after a stunning concert there two years ago. Rakesh Chaurasia is the nephew and pupil of bansuri flute maestro Hariprasad Chaurasia. The bansuri is a simple tube of bamboo that is difficult to master and transcendent in tone. 

Pairing fluent rhythm and melody, these virtuosi tap into South Asian traditions to forge a sound where modernity and myth intertwine.

Zakir Hussain and Rakesh Chaurasia are presented, in part, with support from the Indian Classical Music and Dance Society</p><p>Link: http://dukeperformances.duke.edu/artists-genre/international/hussain_chaurasia</p><p>Start: 20:00 on September 30, 2011.</p><p>Finish: 1:32 on March 5, 2012.</p><p>Location: Page Auditorium</p><br /><a href="Calendar.html">Back to Calendar</a></body></html>
