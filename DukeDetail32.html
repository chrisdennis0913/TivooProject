<h4>Exhibition: Language, Power, Stories, Words: an Exhibit from the Dorothy Allison Papers</h4><p>Category: Social Action</p><p>Description: Dorothy Allison crosses boundaries and defies definitions: a quintessential South Carolinian who has lived in northern California for decades; a lesbian feminist who has broken onto bestseller lists and won mainstream critical acclaim; a writer known for her fiction who has also published poetry and essays and performed a one-woman show; a seemingly fearless activist and advocate for the LGBTQ community who has written compellingly of the fear that lives in all of us. This exhibit includes selections from Allison's writings, activism, and personal life. Sponsored by the Sallie Bingham Center for Women's History and Culture, part of Duke University Libraries, and by the Duke Women's Studies Program. On display in the Rare Book Room Cases, Perkins Library.</p><p>Link: http://exhibits.library.duke.edu/exhibits/show/allison/allison2/intro</p><p>Start: 0:00 on September 15, 2011.</p><p>Finish: 1:32 on March 5, 2012.</p><p>Location: See description</p><br /><a href="Calendar.html">Back to Calendar</a></body></html>
