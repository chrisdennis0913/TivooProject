<h4>In The Service of Others: Everyday People in Black & White</h4><p>Category: Arts</p><p>Description: The Mary Lou Williams Center for Black Culture is proud to host an exhibit that focuses on the humanity of those we sometimes take for granted. Everyday, there are a myriad of hands helping to transform Duke.  These hands nourish students, cut their hair, clean spaces, and build things.  These hands are often invisible in the visible pursuit of higher education. But, without these hands Duke would cease to be. Through black and white photography, Aron Anderson, '10  (Trinity) and W. Edmund Newsome, '11 (Divinity) capture the humanity of those we take for granted. Join us in an exhibit that questions what we take for granted and asks us to celebrate Black people who are "In The Service of Others."</p><p>Link: </p><p>Start: 0:00 on September 16, 2011.</p><p>Finish: 23:15 on March 4, 2012.</p><p>Location: Mary Lou Williams Center</p><br /><a href="Calendar.html">Back to Calendar</a></body></html>
