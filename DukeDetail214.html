<h4>Screen/Society--Special Event--Tarkovsky's "STALKER" - ultra rare 35mm screening of the visually unforgettable classic film!</h4><p>Category: Arts</p><p>Description: Film Screening: STALKER (Andrei Tarkovsky, 1979, 160 min, Soviet Union, in Russian w/ subtitles, Color, 35mm) -- A powerful and haunting sci-fi parable imbued by Tarkovsky with a multi-layered visual resonance and, despite its stately pace, raw emotional impact. Near a gray and unnamed city is the Zone, an alien place guarded by barbed wire and soldiers. Over his wife's numerous objections, a man rises in the dead of night: he's a stalker, one of a handful who have the mental gifts (and who risk imprisonment) to lead people into the Zone to the Room, a place where one's secret hopes come true. That night, he takes two people into the Zone: a popular writer who is burned out, cynical, and questioning his genius; and a quiet scientist more concerned about his knapsack than the journey. -- Received a special award, "the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury," at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival!</p><p>Link: http://ami.duke.edu/events/tags/ScreenSociety/2011/fall</p><p>Start: 19:00 on September 28, 2011.</p><p>Finish: 1:32 on March 5, 2012.</p><p>Location: Bryan Center Griffith Film Theater</p><br /><a href="Calendar.html">Back to Calendar</a></body></html>
