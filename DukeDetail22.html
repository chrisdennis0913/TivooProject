<h4>Exhibition: "Becoming: Photographs from the Wedge Collection"</h4><p>Category: Arts</p><p>Description: The Nasher Museum presents "Becoming: Photographs from the Wedge Collection," featuring more than 100 original photographic portraits of people of color by more than 60 global artists. In some portraits, the subjects have little or no control over the way they are depicted; in others, the subjects become increasingly involved with the photographer. 
All of the artists reject a common tendency to view black communities in terms of conflict or stereotype. Includes includes studio portraitists (Malick Sidibé, James VanDerZee), social documentarians (Milton Rogovin, Jürgen Schadeberg), conceptual artists (Hank Willis Thomas, Carrie Mae Weems) and young contemporary artists whose work is largely unknown in this country (Zanele Muholi, Viviane Sassen).</p><p>Link: http://www.nasher.duke.edu/exhibitions_becoming</p><p>Start: 11:00 on August 17, 2011.</p><p>Finish: 1:32 on March 5, 2012.</p><p>Location: Nasher Museum of Art</p><br /><a href="Calendar.html">Back to Calendar</a></body></html>
