<h4>Writing Culture at 25: Theory, Ethnography, Fieldwork</h4><p>Category: Conferences</p><p>Description: The publication in 1986 of Writing Culture: the Poetics and Politics of Ethnography transformed the field of cultural anthropology. Edited by George Marcus and James Clifford, the essays in the volume critically assessed the ethnographic method of doing fieldwork (on "other" cultures) and writing it up into texts (called "ethnographies") at the heart of the discipline of anthropology. On this occasion of the 25th anniversary of its publication, we revisit Writing Culture to ponder the state of the field, the practice of ethnography, and the politics and poetics of ¿writing culture¿ today.

Participants include James Clifford, James Marcus, Kim Fortun, John Jackson Jr., Hugh Raffles, Danilyn Rutherford, Kathleen Stewart, and Michael Taussig.

Co-sponsored by: the Journal of Cultural Anthropology, Office of the Dean of Arts & Sciences, Duke University Press, the Program in Literature, the John Hope Franklin Humanities Institute, and Marxism & Society.</p><p>Link: </p><p>Start: 15:00 on September 30, 2011.</p><p>Finish: 23:15 on March 4, 2012.</p><p>Location: Smith Warehouse - Bay 4, C105</p><br /><a href="Calendar.html">Back to Calendar</a></body></html>
