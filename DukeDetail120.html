<h4>Screen/Society--2011 French Film Series--"Potiche" ("Trophy Wife")</h4><p>Category: Arts</p><p>Description: "Potiche" (François Ozon, 2010, 103 min, France, 35mm) -- "Potiche" is Francois Ozon's adaptation of the hit comic play from the 1970s, reworked into his own satirical and hilarious take on the war between the sexes and classes.Suzanne - wonderfully played by the reigning queen of French film, Catherine Deneuve - is a submissive, housebound 'trophy wife' who steps in to manage the umbrella factory run by her wealthy and tyrannical husband after the workers go on strike. As she breaks free of her coddled life, proving herself to be a competent and assertive woman of action, she realizes, like many other women who discovered feminism in the 1970s, that the personal really is political. But when her husband returns from a restful cruise in top form, things get complicated. Gérard Depardieu plays a former union leader and Suzanne's ex-beau who still has feelings for her. Features impeccable 70s era set design and costumes! -- Post-screening discussion with Prof. Anne-Gaëlle Saliot!</p><p>Link: http://ami.duke.edu/events/tags/French+Film+Series/2011/fall</p><p>Start: 20:00 on September 26, 2011.</p><p>Finish: 23:15 on March 4, 2012.</p><p>Location: Bryan Center Griffith Film Theater</p><br /><a href="Calendar.html">Back to Calendar</a></body></html>
